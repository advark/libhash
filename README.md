## Description
libHash is C/C++ library that provides a data hashing API. Support algorithms are

* CRC32 as defined in [RFC-1952](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1952)
* MD5 as defined in [RFC-1321](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1321)
* SHA-1 as defined in FIPS 180-2
* SHA-2 224-bits as defined in FIPS 180-2
* SHA-2 256-bits as defined in FIPS 180-2
* SHA-2 384-bits as defined in FIPS 180-2
* SHA-2 512-bits as defined in FIPS 180-2

Please note that this is a preliminary version. At this time, only GCC is supported on Linux platform. However, the code can be easily ported to most of C++ compiler on almost any platform.
A Windows version is planned as well as more hashing algorithm may be included in future as time permits me to do so.
